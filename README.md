# Modelling Physiological Signals to Understand the Cognitive Effect of Takeover Requests in Conditionally Automated Vehicles

### Dataset
The dataset used in this study is available at: https://zenodo.org/records/7319612
This code specifically uses the Exp2.
To use the dataset, download the files and place them in a `AdVitam` folder in the root directory. 

### Code
The AdVitam dataset is preprocessed in the file './Preprocess Physio Data.ipynb'. 
The preprocessed data is then saved in the 'Physiological Preprocessed' folder.
The remaining files are used to train and evaluate the models.

### Models
The models used in this study are:
- Traditional Hidden Markov Models 
- Encoded Hidden Markov Models

### Results
The results of the study are available in the 'Results Analysis' folder.
